# What is this program and how does it work

## First of all - this program was written as part of the study of the course on JS. The author of the program is listed on the page.

## Link of the program: https://semandr.github.io/mapty/

## How it works:

1. You need to enable geolocation in your browser for the map to load.
2. You need to click on any area of the map, after which an input form will appear in the left area of the program. (map may take some time to load)
3. You can select a run or a bike ride on the form, fill in the rest of the fields, and then press Enter
4. After that, a mark with your run or bike ride will appear on the map, and the form will disappear.
5. You can click on the map again. The form will reappear and you can repeat the previous step.
6. When you click on an item in your "sports activity" list, the map will move to the corresponding marker exactly in the center of the map.
